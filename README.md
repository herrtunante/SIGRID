# SIGRID
Systematic Iterative GRID - Global Systematic Grid of points at 1x1 km with sub-nested grids at any spacing


## How to download the grid
To explore the grid, as it is very large, we have created a KML file that allows for download of the grid in tiles of 10 by 10 degrees.

You can access it through this [Google Earth file (KMZ)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/herrtunante/SIGRID/main/resources/SIGRID_Grid_1000m_1_subgrid.kmz)

Locate the area for which you need the grid points and then click on the tile. There will be a popup with a link to download the ZIP file containing the plots for that tile.
